# Algorithm_01

You will find in the different Readme(s) Model1.md Model2.md Model3.md in order respectively the answer material for my test on model 1 on model 2 and model 3.

I have also uploaded the code I used.

Side Note :

As discussed with leonardkkh@cau.ac.kr by email, my tensorflow version was 2.5 when I tried everything for the project and I got good result as expected, there is just one tiny thing to note is that for :

<img width="795" alt="Capture d’écran 2021-06-12 à 14 06 26" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48728092/121798270-4450ba00-cc60-11eb-92c4-427910a54795.png">

my total of is over 1875 compared to 60000 as the demo video just because of my tensorflow version.

60000 : The number of data

1875  : The number of iteration when batch-size is 32 ( 32 * 1875 = 60000 )

all this created by the tensorflow version difference.

leonardkkh@cau.ac.kr told me I didn't have to change my version if the prediction were correct, as they are so I didn't.

Thanks for the understanding.
